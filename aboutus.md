  <h3> Stephanie Simpson </h3>
  <img class="profile_img" src="/assets/img/mentors/mentor_steph_simpson.png">
  Stephanie is a fifth-year PhD student in Dr. Brian Levine’s lab at the Rotman Research Institute. She is an NSERC-Postgraduate Scholarship-Doctoral award holder and was a standing committee member of the Research Training Centre for three years. Broadly, Stephanie is interested in studying the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval in humans. One aspect of her doctoral work applies EEG techniques to investigate how the neurophysiological hallmarks of overnight sleep impact our ability to recall real-world events over time. Another stream of her research investigates how variability in hippocampal subfield structure relates to individual differences in memory using a unique population of people with severely deficient autobiographical memory. In her downtime, you can find her at the beach playing volleyball or taking her two dogs for a walk.

  <h3> Dr. Krista Mitchnick </h3>
  <img class="profile_img" src="/assets/img/mentors/mentor_krista_mitchnick.jpeg">
  Krista obtained a PhD in Experimental Psychology and Neuroscience in 2018 from the University of Guelph (funded through NSERC), where her research focused on the neurobiology of learning and memory in rodents. She was awarded the top Psychology PhD dissertation award. Having always been torn between basic research and clinical work, Krista then completed a PhD in Clinical Psychology - Neuropsychology stream in 2023 at York University (funded through the Elia Scholars program and VISTA). Here, her research took an interdisciplinary approach, assessing the involvement of individual hippocampal subfields in perception and memory using brain damaged case studies and rat lesion models. She was also awarded the top Psychology PhD dissertation award. As part of her clinical training, she completed a residency position in Clinical Neuropsychology at the London Health Sciences Centre (London, ON). Presently, Krista is a postdoctoral fellow at Baycrest Academy working with Dr. Brian Levine where her research is centred around characterizing the neural correlates and functional outcomes of individual differences in autobiographical memory, focusing on both basic mechanisms and clinical relevance. Clinically, she continues to conduct neuropsychological assessments for individuals across the lifespan in private practice (supervised practice). Outside of her research and clinical work, you can find her soaking up the sun and a good book at the beach, hiking with friends, at the gym, or playing board games far too competitively.
  
  <h3> Dr. Ryan Yeung </h3>
  
  Ryan completed his PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Waterloo in 2022, studying memories that spring to mind involuntarily (e.g., recurrent or intrusive memories). Though these memories are surprisingly common in daily life, they also relate to symptoms of mental health disorders. For instance, the emotional quality and the content (i.e., what people report remembering) of these memories are systematically related to one's symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. In his postdoc, he investigates cognitive and neural mechanisms of why emotional memories persist or fade away. He is particularly interested in hypotheses that emotional or traumatic memories are enhanced due to their strong ability to evoke mental imagery; as such, emotional remembering might be modulated by individuals’ trait-level abilities to generate such imagery. Other research interests of his include computational methods of analyzing autobiographical memories, such as natural language processing and machine learning. Outside of research, he's a fan of hipster music, hipster tabletop role-playing games, and insisting that he's not actually a hipster.

For her postdoc, Dr. Stefanelli joined the lab of Dr. Iva Zovkic at the University of Toronto Mississauga where she studied how histone variants can influence memory formation and the molecular pathways that regulate their turnover in neurons. In 2023, Dr. Stefanelli started her own lab at the University of Ottawa. Her research focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms driving brain development. More specifically, her lab uses molecular biology and genomic techniques to understand how chaperones of histone variants shape gene expression during brain development by depositing or removing H2A.Z.
