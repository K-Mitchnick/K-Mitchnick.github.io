## *PhD students/candidates*

### Steph Simpson

<img class="profile_img" src="/assets/img/mentor_steph.png">

Stephanie is a fifth-year PhD student in Dr. Brian Levine’s lab at the Rotman Research Institute. She is an NSERC-Postgraduate Scholarship-Doctoral award holder and was a standing committee member of the Research Training Centre for three years. Broadly, Stephanie is interested in studying the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval in humans. One aspect of her doctoral work applies EEG techniques to investigate how the neurophysiological hallmarks of overnight sleep impact our ability to recall real-world events over time. Another stream of her research investigates howvariability in hippocampal subfield structure relates to individual differences in memory using a unique population of people with severely deficient autobiographical memory. In her downtime, you can find her at the beach playing volleyball or taking her two dogs for a walk. 

## *Postdoctoral fellows*

### Dr. Krista Mitchnick

### Dr. Ryan Yeung

Ryan completed his PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Waterloo in 2022, studying memories that spring to mind involuntarily (e.g., recurrent or intrusive memories). Though these memories are surprisingly common in daily life, they also relate to symptoms of mental health disorders. For instance, the emotional quality and the content (i.e., what people report remembering) of these memories are systematically related to one's symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. In his postdoc, he investigates cognitive and neural mechanisms of why emotional memories persist or fade away. He is particularly interested in hypotheses that emotional or traumatic memories are enhanced due to their strong ability to evoke mental imagery; as such, emotional remembering might be modulated by individuals’ trait-level abilities to generate such imagery. Other research interests of his include computational methods of analyzing autobiographical memories, such as natural language processing and machine learning. Outside of research, he's a fan of hipster music, hipster tabletop role-playing games, and insisting that he's not actually a hipster.
